 * Dynatrace Environment API

 *  Documentation of the Dynatrace Environment API v2. Resources here generally supersede those in v1. Migration of resources from v1 is in progress.   If you miss a resource, consider using the Dynatrace Environment API v1. To read about use cases and examples, refer to the [help page](https://dt-url.net/2u23k1k) .  Notes about compatibility: * Operations marked as early adopter or preview may be changed in non-compatible ways, although we try to avoid this. * We may add new enum constants without incrementing the API version; thus, clients need to handle unknown enum constants gracefully.

You need to set one of these criteria:   * Entity type: &#x60;type(\&quot;TYPE\&quot;)&#x60;  * Dynatrace entity ID: &#x60;entityId(\&quot;id\&quot;)&#x60;. You can specify several IDs, separated by a comma (&#x60;entityId(\&quot;id-1\&quot;,\&quot;id-2\&quot;)&#x60;).   And you can add one or several of the following criteria. Values are case-sensitive and the &#x60;EQUALS&#x60; operator is used unless otherwise specified.   * Tag: &#x60;tag(\&quot;value\&quot;)&#x60;. Tags in &#x60;[context]key:value&#x60;, &#x60;key:value&#x60;, and &#x60;value&#x60; formats are detected and parsed automatically. Any colons (&#x60;:&#x60;) that are part of the key or value must be escaped with a backslash(&#x60;\\&#x60;), otherwise, it will be interpreted as the separator between the key and the value. All tag values are case-sensitive.  * Management zone ID: &#x60;mzId(123)&#x60;  * Management zone name: &#x60;mzName(\&quot;value\&quot;)&#x60; * Entity name: &#x60;entityName(\&quot;value\&quot;)&#x60;. By default this filters for entities, whose name **contains** the given value and is **not** case sensitive.   You can modify the behaviour with postfixes: (all of them still not case-sensitive)  * &#x60;entityName.equals&#x60; uses exact matches instead of the contains logic  * &#x60;entityName.startsWith&#x60; filters for names that start with the given value  * &#x60;entityName.in&#x60; behaves exactly the same as &#x60;entityName.equals&#x60;, but allows more than one value – one of which has to match  * surrounding any of the aforementioned entity name predicates with &#x60;caseSensitive&#x60; will make them case sensitive. (For example &#x60;caseSensitive(entityName.equals(caseSensitiveName))&#x60;) * Health state (HEALTHY,UNHEALTHY): &#x60;healthState(\&quot;HEALTHY\&quot;)&#x60; * First seen timestamp: &#x60;firstSeenTms.lte(now-3h)&#x60;. You can use any of the values also available in the from/to parameters.  The following modifiers for this predicate exist:  * &#x60;lte&#x60;: Less than or equal  * &#x60;lt&#x60;: Less than  * &#x60;gte&#x60;: Greater than or equal  * &#x60;gt&#x60;: Greater than * Entity property: &#x60;&lt;attribute&gt;(\&quot;value1\&quot;,\&quot;value2\&quot;)&#x60; and &#x60;&lt;attribute&gt;.exists()&#x60;. String-based attributes are **not** case sensitive, but can be used in combination with &#x60;caseSensitive&#x60; to change that. * Relationships: &#x60;fromRelationships.&lt;relationshipName&gt;()&#x60;, &#x60;toRelationships.&lt;relationshipName&gt;()&#x60;. The value can be any valid entity selector.  For example: &#x60;type(HOST),fromRelationships.isInstanceOf(type(HOST_GROUP), entityName.startsWith(host group name))&#x60;  * Case sensitivity: &#x60;caseSensitive(&lt;any entity name or string-based attribute predicate&gt;)&#x60; (see entity name above) * Negation: &#x60;not(&lt;any predicate except type&gt;)&#x60; negates the given predicate.  For more information, see the [Entity selector](https://dt-url.net/apientityselector) help page.   To set several criteria, separate them with a comma (&#x60;,&#x60;). For example, &#x60;type(\&quot;HOST\&quot;),healthState(\&quot;HEALTHY\&quot;)&#x60;. Only results matching **all** criteria are included in response.
