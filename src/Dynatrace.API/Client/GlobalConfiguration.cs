/* 
 * Dynatrace Environment API
 *
 *  Documentation of the Dynatrace Environment API v2. Resources here generally supersede those in v1. Migration of resources from v1 is in progress.   If you miss a resource, consider using the Dynatrace Environment API v1. To read about use cases and examples, refer to the [help page](https://dt-url.net/2u23k1k) .  Notes about compatibility: * Operations marked as early adopter or preview may be changed in non-compatible ways, although we try to avoid this. * We may add new enum constants without incrementing the API version; thus, clients need to handle unknown enum constants gracefully.
 *
 * OpenAPI spec version: 2.0
